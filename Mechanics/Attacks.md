## Melee Weapon Attack

Deal damage to a target within your weapon's [reach](Range.md), or choose one of the following options for an additional effect.

**Driving Attack:** You make the attack roll with 1 bane. On a success, you and the target move a number of yards equal to your Strength modifier in the same direction.

**Guarded Attack:** You make the attack roll with 1 bane, but the next creature to make an attack roll against your Defense before the end of the round does so with 1 bane.

**Lunging Attack:** You can increase your reach by 1 yard, but you make the attack roll with 1 bane.

**Shifting Attack:** You make the attack roll with 1 bane. On a success, your movement does not trigger free attacks from the target until the end of the round.

**Unbalancing Attack:** You make the attack roll with 1 bane. On a success, if the target is your Size or smaller, it must make an Agility challenge roll. On a failure, the target falls [[Afflictions#prone|prone]].

## Ranged Weapon Attack

Deal damage to a target within your weapon's [[range]], or choose one of the following options for an additional effect.

**Called Shot:** You attack a specific location on the target’s body. You can use this option only if the target has a physical body. Make the attack roll with 2 banes. On a success, the attack has an additional effect as determined by the GM. Attacking a creature’s eyes might impose 1 bane on all rolls the target makes that rely on sight, for example.

**Distant Shot:** You can attack a target that is beyond your weapon’s [[range]], but no more than twice the weapon’s range. You make the attack roll with 1 bane.

**Staggering Shot:** You make the attack roll with 2 banes. On a success, a target that is your Size or smaller must make an Agility challenge roll. On a failure, the target falls [[Afflictions#prone|prone]].

## Charge

When you use an action to charge, you make attack rolls and challenge rolls with 1 bane until the end of the round. Move up to your Speed. At any point during your movement, make one attack with a [[melee]] weapon or with an attribute to [[Attacks#Knock Down|knock down]] or [[Attacks#Shove|shove]] a creature.

## Disarm

Choose one target creature within your reach that’s holding an object. Make a Strength or Agility attack roll against the higher of the target’s Strength or Agility. If you are unarmed, you make this roll with 2 banes. On a success, the target drops one object it is holding of your choice.

## Distract

Choose one target creature within short range of you that can see you. Make an Intellect attack roll against the target’s Intellect. On a success, the target makes its next attack roll or challenge roll before the end of the round with 2 banes.

## Escape

You can use this action if you are [[Afflictions#Grab|grabbed]]. Make a Strength or Agility attack roll against the Strength of the creature that has grabbed you. A success removes the grabbed affliction and lets you move up to half your Speed. This movement does not trigger free attacks from the creature that had grabbed you.

## Feint

Choose one target creature within short range of you that can see you. Make an Agility attack roll against the target’s Perception. On a success, you make the next attack roll against the target’s Defense or Agility before the end of the next round with 2 boons. Alternatively, your movement does not trigger free attacks from the target for 1 round.

## Grab

You must have at least one hand free to grab, and you cannot be grabbing another creature. Choose one target creature within your reach that has a physical body (not a spirit, for example) and make a Strength or Agility attack roll against the target’s Agility. If you choose a creature you are already grabbing, you automatically get a success.

On a success, the target becomes [[grabbed]] until the end of the next round. If you are prevented from using actions (such as because you are [[dazed]], [[stunned]], or [[unconscious]], the grabbed affliction ends. The grabbed affliction also ends if you move or are moved to a position where you can no longer reach the grabbed target.

On a success, the target falls [[Afflictions#prone|prone]]

If the target is larger than you, you make this roll with 1 bane for each point of Size it is larger. You make this roll with 1 boon if the target is smaller than you. On a success, you move the target 1 yard away from you, plus a number of yards equal to your Strength modifier (minimum total distance 1 yard).
